## Characterizing and Predicting the Niche-Specific Genomic Features of ESKAPEE Pathogens

In this project, I am designing machine learning models that predict ecological niches based on genomic data and identifying conserved ESKAPEE genes related to pathogenicity based on niche localization. 


Current progress that repo reflects:
* Processed genomic metadata retrieved from NCBI GenBank and assessed genome quality metrics, including CheckM contamination, completeness, number of contigs, and N50 contig size
* Completed feature creation by categorizing niches based on a combination of host disease and isolation source metadata
* Made supplementary plots of genome quality and niche proportions
